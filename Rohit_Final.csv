He was struck in front of middle and the only thing that could have saved him was if the ball had pitched outside leg, it didn't and a very good decision from umpire Ranmore Martinesz. <b>Rohit lbw b Dananjaya 54(45) [4s-5 6s-3]</b>",0,GoodLength,wicket_to_wicket,Sweep,norun,right arm off break,Dananjaya,83.5,18463,1, Lbw!!,beaten,away,bad,Sri Lanka,Pallekele International Cricket Stadium,Unknown,51,1,Fielding,DN

A shot of a player whose team is 4-0 up in the series already, and whose own form has been brilliant and so the confidence is there. He bends across, trying to scoop the ball from outside off over short fine leg.

After getting out, he shadow-practices the pull - trying to suggest that he should've played it down. Didn't roll his wrists sufficiently enough for him to get on top of the ball.

HotSpot didn't show anything on the bat. The Snicko showed a spike though. It was a 50-50 call and it went in favour of the home side. <b>Rohit c Wade b Hastings 99(108) [4s-9 6s-1]</b>",0,GoodLength,wicket_to_wicket,Late_Cut,norun,right arm fast medium,Hastings,137.4,14881,1, Caught!!,beaten,away,bad,Australia,Sydney Cricket Ground,ThirdMan,109,1,Fielding,DN
0,"Doug Bracewell to Rohit, <b>out</b> Lbw!! PLUMBAHHH. The first incision has been made. Rohit has a brain freeze and throws his wicket away. That is the case with him every now and then. It was a fuller length delivery zooming in on the stumps, Rohit was aiming for a heave across the line, plays down the wrong line and misses. The ball pings him on the back pad in front of middle and Bruce Oxenford raises his dreaded finger. Would've gone on to crash the middle stump. Rohit is disappointed as he trudges off. <b>Rohit lbw b Doug Bracewell 14(26) [4s-1 6s-1]</b>",0,GoodLength,wicket_to_wicket,No_shot,norun,right arm medium,Doug Bracewell,136.7,16825,1, Lbw!!,beaten,home,bad,New Zealand,Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium,Point,27,1,Fielding,DN
1,"Boult to Rohit, <b>out</b> Caught by Ronchi!! He is gone and he is in some excruciating pain. The Physio is attending him as he tries to trudge back. Rahane rushed to him from the other end just to have a check with him. Mrs. Sharma in the crowd also looks pensive and concerned. Might have been the bicep. Coming back to the delivery, it was a back of a length delivery outside off and Rohit trying to punch it away through the off-side, gets a thick edge to Ronchi. <b>Rohit c Ronchi b Boult 15(27) [4s-1 6s-1]</b>",0,GoodLength,outside_stumps,Edge,norun,left arm fast medium,Boult,133,16826,1, Caught!!,beaten,home,bad,New Zealand,Feroz Shah Kotla,Unknown,27,1,Fielding,DN
0,"Southee to Rohit, <b>out</b> Lbw!! <b>Shout for LBW and given</b>. Rohit takes a while to move, probably just disappointed with himself more than anything else because it looked absolutely plumb. This is excellent cricket from Southee. Surely a slower ball with the new ball was uncalled for, especially with grass on the pitch and Rohit wasn't expecting that. He was beaten on the flick and it hit him right in front of middle, would have at least crashed into leg stump. 41/2 and India are in a spot of bother. <b>Rohit lbw b Southee 13(21) [4s-2]</b>",0,Full,wicket_to_wicket,Flick,norun,right arm fast medium,Southee,128.7,16827,1, Lbw!!,beaten,home,bad,New Zealand,Punjab Cricket Association Stadium,Point,22,1,Fielding,DN
0,"Southee to Rohit, <b>out</b> Caught by Watling!! <b>Edged and gone</b>. A replica of the delivery we saw in the previous over, the only difference was that this time it kissed Rohit's bat, unlike the previous occasion. Peach of a delivery this. Came in with the angle and pitched on off, Rohit had to play at it, tried to defend and the ball moved away a touch to kiss his bat and settle into the mitts of the keeper. NZ strike early. After those two cracking fours off Boult, Rohit is gone. <b>Rohit c Watling b Southee 11(19) [4s-2]</b>",0,GoodLength,wicket_to_wicket,Edge,norun,right arm fast medium,Southee,128.7,16828,1, Caught!!,beaten,home,bad,New Zealand,JSCA International Stadium Complex,Unknown,19,0,Batting,DN
0,"Boult to Rohit, <b>out</b> Caught by Neesham!! Straight to the fielder this time. Jimmy Neesham steadies himself and accepts the chance gleefully. Another short ball and another mistimed pull from Rohit Sharma, doesn't quite transfer his weight onto his back foot and the ball just climbed onto him. Was hurried and it lands in Neesham's nest at deep mid-wicket. <b>Rohit c Neesham b Boult 70(65) [4s-5 6s-3]</b>",0,Short,wicket_to_wicket,Pull_hook,norun,left arm fast medium,Boult,133,16829,1, Caught!!,beaten,home,bad,New Zealand,Dr. Y.S.

0,"Al-Amin to Rohit, <b>out</b> Caught by Soumya Sarkar!! Now that is a stunning catch in the deep. Needed some brilliance to remove Rohit Sharma and Soumya Sarkar has taken a blinder. Rohit slowly drags himself off the field after an excellent innings. Al-Amin bangs the slower ball short, Rohit sits back and plays the pull, hits it flat, the man at deep mid-wicket runs to his left, dives low and takes it with both hands. This is a key wicket for Bangladesh at this stage, for Rohit was threatening to go big. <b>Rohit c Soumya Sarkar b Al-Amin 83(55) [4s-7 6s-3]</b>",0,Short,outside_stumps,Pull_hook,norun,right arm fast medium,Al-Amin,120,16335,1, Caught!!,beaten,away,bad,Bangladesh,Shere Bangla National Stadium,Midwicket,55,0,Fielding,DN
0,"Amir to Rohit, <b>out</b> Lbw!! There you go! This is the start you want defending a small score. Head coach Waqar Younis would be very happy with Amir's effort. No freebies, warmed up nicely and running in fast. Full and swinging back in, once again Rohit is late on the defence, hit plumb in front of middle stump. Loud shout and the umpire was under pressure again. Thought about it for a long time and raised the finger, much to the delight of the Pakistani players. Rohit, the in-form batsman is gone for a silver duck and that is a massive blow for India. The replay shows that Rohit played outside the line of that delivery on that occasion. <b>Rohit lbw b Amir 0(2)</b>",0,Full,wicket_to_wicket,Defensive_shot,norun,left arm fast medium,Amir,139.4,16338,1, Lbw!!,beaten,away,bad,Pakistan,Shere Bangla National Stadium,Unknown,2,1,Fielding,DN
0,"Kulasekara to Rohit, <b>out</b> Caught by Kapugedera!! Just a fly slip and it goes straight to him. Must say that it was a sharp low catch. The fielder did very well to stay low, which was key to this grab. Fullish and outside off stump, Rohit plays a loose drive away from the body, the ball just moves away from the body and takes a thick outside edge, Kapugedera does the rest. Rohit wears a disappointed look as he removes his gloves on his way back. This is an excellent start for Sri Lanka. It's 16/2 inside 4 overs and the pressure is on India. <b>Rohit c Kapugedera b Kulasekara 15(14) [4s-3]</b>",0,Full,outside_stumps,Edge,norun,right arm fast medium,Kulasekara,125.9,16341,1, Caught!!,beaten,away,bad,Sri Lanka,Shere Bangla National Stadium,Point,14,1,Fielding,DN
0,"Qadeer Ahmed to Rohit, <b>out</b> Caught by Naveed!! This was all too much to take. Ironically perishes off a tripe ball. Short and wide, Rohit could have murdered it. Instead manages just a tame toe-end on the uppish cut and it settles nicely into the hands of third man who just had to wait for the ball to arrive. <b>Rohit c Naveed b Qadeer Ahmed 39(28) [4s-7 6s-1]</b>",0,Short,outside_stumps,Late_Cut,norun,right arm medium,Qadeer Ahmed,131.4,16343,1, Caught!!,beaten,away,bad,United Arab Emirates,Shere Bangla National Stadium,ThirdMan,28,0,Batting,DN
0,"Al-Amin to Rohit, <b>out</b> Caught by Soumya Sarkar!! Edgedddd, only one slip in place and the fielder makes no mistake. Short of a length delivery outside off stump, Al-Amin bowls with a scrambled seam and sometimes the batsman can't make out which way it is going to go. This one just held its line, Rohit played a flashy-drive away from the body and paid the price. Thick edge resulted, which was swallowed to his left by Sarkar. Rohit is a batsman in form and this is a massive blow for India and the perfect start for Bangladesh. <b>Rohit c Soumya Sarkar b Al-Amin 1(5)</b>",0,GoodLength,outside_stumps,Edge,norun,right arm fast medium,Al-Amin,120,16345,1, Caught!!,beaten,away,bad,Bangladesh,Shere Bangla National Stadium,ThirdMan,6,1,Fielding,DN
